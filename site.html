            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their
                technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by
                non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture with a security
                hacker – someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer
                systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them – hacking can also be utilized by
                legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking
                techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include
                using anonymity tools (such as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing as
                criminals themselves.[1][2] Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal
                conduct of their work. On the other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law
                enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by state actors as a
                weapon of both legal and illegal warfare

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">General definition</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Reflecting the two types of hackers, there are two definitions of the
                word "hacker":

                Originally, hacker simply meant advanced computer technology enthusiast (both hardware and software) and
                adherent of programming subculture; see hacker culture.[3]
                Someone who is able to subvert computer security. If doing so for malicious purposes, the person can
                also be called a cracker.[4]
                Today, mainstream usage of "hacker" mostly refers to computer criminals, due to the mass media usage of
                the word since the 1990s.[5] This includes what hacker slang calls "script kiddies", people breaking
                into computers using programs written by others, with very little knowledge about the way they work.
                This usage has become so predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings
                exist.[6] While the self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by
                computer security hackers, people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion
                related usage incorrect, and emphasize the difference between the two by calling security breakers
                "crackers" (analogous to a safecracker).

                The controversy is usually based on the assertion that the term originally meant someone messing about
                with something in a positive sense, that is, using playful cleverness to achieve a goal. But then, it is
                supposed, the meaning of the term shifted over the decades and came to refer to computer criminals.[7]

                As the security-related usage has spread more widely, the original meaning has become less known. In
                popular usage and in the media, "computer intruders" or "computer criminals" is the exclusive meaning of
                the word today. (For example, "An Internet 'hacker' broke through state government security systems in
                March.") In the computer enthusiast (Hacker Culture) community, the primary meaning is a complimentary
                description for a particularly brilliant programmer or technical expert. (For example, "Linus Torvalds,
                the creator of Linux, is considered by some to be a hacker.") A large segment of the technical community
                insist the latter is the "correct" usage of the word (see the Jargon File definition below).</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Representation in mainstream media</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> The mainstream media's current usage of the term may be traced back to
                the early 1980s. When the term, previously used only among computer enthusiasts, was introduced to wider
                society by the mainstream media in 1983,[8] even those in the computer community referred to computer
                intrusion as "hacking", although not as the exclusive definition of the word. In reaction to the
                increasing media use of the term exclusively with the criminal connotation, the computer community began
                to differentiate their terminology. Alternative terms such as "cracker" were coined in an effort to
                maintain the distinction between "hackers" within the legitimate programmer community and those
                performing computer break-ins. Further terms such as "black hat", "white hat" and "gray hat" developed
                when laws against breaking into computers came into effect, to distinguish criminal activities from
                those activities which were legal.
